Particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM 2.5) is dangerous to humans, as particles of that size can travel deep into the respiratory track. These particles increase the likelihood and severity of respiratory and cardiovascular complications, like asthma and heart disease. In the winter, wood burning stoves, a known source of PM 2.5, are a commonly used in Keene, New Hampshire. We aim to predict the air inversions themselves, throughout the winter months, so that we can ask residents to stop or reduce the use of wood burning stoves at those times.
